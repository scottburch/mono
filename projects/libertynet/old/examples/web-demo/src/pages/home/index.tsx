            <h4>Welcome to LibertyNet</h4>
            <p>
                LibertyNet is the first freedom/free speech platform for the internet.
                We encourage everyone, especially developers to become part of our community.
            </p>
            <p>
                For individuals and content providers, you are your own internet service.  You are your own Twitter,
                Instagram or Facebook.
                <ul>
                    <li>Set-up a peer-to-peer data server with our simple instructions</li>
                    <li>Pick the modules you want to include</li>
                    <li>Enjoy the freedom of running your own internet service without censorship</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
                <p>
                For developers, this will provide you a platform to build your applications
                where individual liberty is the only rule.
            </p>
                <p>
                <ul><li>No censorship</li> <li>no rules</li><li> no terms of service</li></ul>

            <h5>How is this possible?</h5>
            <p>
                By using DAG technology, we are able to create a peer-to-peer community of distributed nodes.
                Since data is not held in a central location, no corporation or government can shut it down or control the content.
                You are in charge of what you see and do.  You are the service.
            </p>

            <h5>What do I need to do to join?</h5>
            <p>
                To join the network you will run a node on the network to ensure that liberty is distributed as widely as possible.
                <b> A warning... This does not come without risk.</b>  If someone adds illegal content to the network, I can not remove it
                and you will have a copy of it.  If you get the attention of authorities, they could use this against you.

                But, if you are willing to take a risk for the sake of liberty, this is your opportunity.
